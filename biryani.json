    "Start by gathering all the necessary ingredients for the biryani: mutton pieces, basmati rice, yogurt, onions, tomatoes, ginger-garlic paste, biryani masala, whole spices (like bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom), red chili powder, turmeric, saffron, milk, lemon juice, fresh herbs (coriander and mint), ghee or oil, and salt.",
    "Marinate the mutton pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, half of the chopped fresh herbs, biryani masala, red chili powder, turmeric, lemon juice, and salt. Let it sit for at least 2 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator for best results.",
    "Wash the basmati rice thoroughly until the water runs clear and then soak it in water for about 30 minutes.",
    "In a large pot or pan, heat ghee or oil. Add the whole spices and allow them to sizzle for a minute.",
    "Add sliced onions to the pot and fry them until they are golden brown. Remove half for garnishing later.",
    "To the same pot, add tomatoes and cook until they turn soft. Then, add the marinated mutton and cook on low heat until it's half-done.",
    "In another large pot, boil water with salt and add the soaked rice. Cook the rice until it's 70% done and then drain the water.",
    "Layer the partially cooked rice over the mutton in the first pot.",
    "Sprinkle the remaining fried onions, fresh herbs, and saffron (dissolved in milk) over the rice. Drizzle some ghee on top.",
    "Seal the pot with a tight-fitting lid or dough. Cook on low heat (dum) for about 25-30 minutes. Make sure the biryani is cooked in its own steam. Once done, gently fluff the rice and serve hot with raita or salad."
